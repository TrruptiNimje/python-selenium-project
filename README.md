- To run all the tests of a project Open the terminal and just write 'pytest', and Python will recognise all the tests written in all the files of that project. (run pytest by navigating to the project)
- How to run a python file from the command line:  Navigate to the project folder and type 'python3 file path/file name'
- @pytest.mark.tag (tag here represents any name you wish to give to the tag for this mark) ---- this feature can be used in a scenario for example I wish to create a smoke test set or regeression test set from the existing tests then tagging them with this feature will run specified tagged test only.
        -- To run the specifically tagged tests we need to create an environment by navigating to 'Edit configuration from run button dropdown' > name the test (example: smoke test) > add arguments '-m tagname', now save and run the tests using this environment.
